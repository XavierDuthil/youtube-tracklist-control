# YouTube™ Tracklist Control
MIT-licensed open source extension for Google Chrome, Firefox and Chromium.  

This extension provides useful functionalities when watching music-compilation videos on YouTube™.  

This extension builds its own interactive tracklist by scanning for timestamped tracks in the video description or comments.  

The tracklist can be displayed from any tab and controlled via configurable global keyboard shortcuts (defaults are the keyboard's media buttons).
